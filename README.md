# Mysterious-Math

### What it does?
	
	Windows app that allows you to generate and check some of the mysterious numbers in Mathematics. You can generate and check for 
	
	1. Armstrong Number
			Any number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. 
			For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.
			153 = (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3)  
			where:  
				(1*1*1)=1  
				(5*5*5)=125  
				(3*3*3)=27  
			So:  
				1+125+27=153
				
	2. Perfect Number	
			Any number can be a Perfect Number, If the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself is equal to that number. 
			For example, 28 is a perfect number because 
			28 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 and 
			the sum of these values are: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 (Remember, we have to exclude the number itself. That’s why we haven’t added 28 here)
			
	3. Kaprekar Number
			A non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.
			For example, 45 is Kaprekar number 
			45^2 = 2025
			20 + 25 = 45
			
	4. Ramanujam Number
			The smallest number representable in two ways as a sum of two cubes
			For example, 1729 is a Ramanujam number
			1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
			
	5. Amicable Number
			Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number
			For example, 220 and 284 are amicable numbers
			Proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284
			Proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.
